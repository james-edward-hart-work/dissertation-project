# Welcome to James Hart's Dissertation Project
*University of St Andrews - BSc Computer Science - Class of 2025*

My dissertation was to create a tool for visualising and simulating finite state automata, to assist eduction at the University of St Andrews. Users may create and simulate input on both deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata through two graphical methods - Hotkeys and a Context Menu. **See UserManual.pdf.**

For further detail, please see 'DissertationReport.pdf' which contains my final dissertation.
